Tell a story about explaining a Phishing attempt. Who is doing it? to whom? why? Is it recognized? why or why not?
I had gotten an email on my gmail when I was trying to reset my password to my PSN and I found an email saying YOU WON
1000 DOLLARS so It said I had to put my personal info and realized immediatley that it was spam I could'nt recognize a real official 
email and so I put it in the trash.
